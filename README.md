# Tableau--Mainland-City
City of Mainland has been purchasing lots of bicycle products and parts across the world for its citizen usages. Each product is classified and track based on order date, delivery due date and shipment, as these are essential to provide the citizens the procurement information.

Create KPI with Low, Medium, High indicator based on Net Purchase Amount with the following conditions:
- If the Net Purchase Amount is less than CAD 10,000 then “Low”
- If the Net Purchase Amount between CAD 10,000 and CAD 20,000 then “Medium”
- If the Net Purchase Amount greater than CAD 20,000 then “HIGH”
Hint:
Calculation Information
Purchased Amount = UnitPrice * OrderQty
Discount Amount = UnitPriceDiscount * Purchased amount
Net Purchase Amount = Purchased amount – Discount amount
